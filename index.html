              <p>&ldquo;On March 4, 2014, Gawker's tech-focused subsidiary Valleywag published &ldquo;Startup Flying Dateable Women to San Francisco Like It's Imperial Japan,&rdquo; stating, &ldquo;A startup called The Dating Ring has taken its inspiration from an unlikely source: the &lsquo;comfort women&rsquo; of World War II.&rdquo;</p>

          <h3>Hacker News</h3>
          <p>Hacker News is a popular news aggregation site that is often unfriendly towards views that don't fall in line with heteronormative patriarchy. Its moderation standards are entirely opaque and beyond reproach.</p>
          <figure>
            <blockquote>
              <p>The mechanisms and implementation of moderation are completely shrouded from us. The subtle tools of content and conversation massaging unknown.</p>

              <p>People are hellbanned for what often seems like capricious, abuse-of-power reasons. People are slowbanned at varying levels of forced aggravation, presumably to encourage them, passive-aggressively, to get lost.</p>

              <p>The people with the power to endorse and ignore comments are the people with the most deeply vested interest in Hacker News continuing as it has up to now. People who see significant problems with the Hacker News community, whether they’ve been quiet members of Hacker News for years or they’re just joining, have no power to voice their opinions without the active endorsement of multiple Hacker News oldsters.</p>

          <h2>how to block</h2>
          <p>the-list is easily added to your own hosts file by curling the-lists's text file.</p>
          <p>By running this command in your terminal, the contents of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llkats/the-list/master/list.txt">list.txt</a> will be appended to your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file.</p>
          <p><code>curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llkats/the-list/master/list.txt >> /etc/hosts</code></p>
          <p>The flags are there to handle error cases more gracefully and safely handle redirects. See man curl for a more comprehensive explanation.</p>
